# Introduction
Design patterns are reusable solutions to common problems when designing an application or a system. They are used to represent some of the best practices adapted by experienced object-oriented software developers.

The 23 Gang of Four (GoF) patterns are generally considered the foundation for all other patterns. They are categorized in three groups: [Creational](#Creational), [Structural](#Structural), and [Behavioral](#Behavioral).

## Creational
| Name                                           | Description                                           |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| [Abstract Factory](abstract-factory/README.md) | Creates an instance of several families of classes    |
| [Builder](builder/README.md)                   | Separates object construction from its representation |
| [Factory Method](factory-method/README.md)     | Creates an instance of several derived classes        |
| [Prototype](prototype/README.md)               | Creates an instance by cloning an existing object     |
| [Singleton](singleton/README.md)               | Provides a single instance of a class                 |
